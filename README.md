J.A.R.V.I.S. (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is a fictional artificial intelligence. The AI is based on the Marvel Comics character Edwin Jarvis, who was the household 

butler of the Stark family. After the first Iron Man film, the character was introduced into the American comic books published by Marvel Comics.


Is it an A.I.?


A lot of people will argue that the virtual assistant that we have created is not an A.I, but it is the output of the bunch of the statement. But, if we look at the very basic 


level, the sole purpose of A.I is to develop machines that can perform human tasks with the same effectiveness or even more effectively than humans.


It is a fact that our virtual assistant is not a very good example of A.I., but it is an A.I. !
